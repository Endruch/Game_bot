Autofarm Bot Script for Requiem: Memento Mori
This script is written in Python and intended to be run through PyCharm or any compatible Python environment. It uses low-level keyboard and mouse input emulation to automate boss farming in the Dominator zone of Requiem: Memento Mori.
The bot was developed specifically to help automate repetitive gameplay by simulating key presses and mouse clicks with precise timing.
How It Works
The script runs an infinite loop (while True) that cycles through five pets:
Kazar
Lantanode
Ennon
Nakstech
Humbaba
For each pets, the following steps are performed:
A specific skill is activated via a hotkey.
The boss is summoned or reappears (triggered via the 7 key).
F1 and F2 are pressed (usually for buffs or preparation).
A left mouse click simulates the attack.
Key 9 is pressed (could be an extra skill or consumable).
Key H is pressed (possibly a finisher or looting action).
A 61-second wait follows (likely to allow for cooldown or boss respawn).
After going through all five bosses, the loop repeats indefinitely.
All actions are carefully timed with time.sleep(...) to match in-game animations, ability cooldowns, and summon delays, ensuring a stable and repeatable farming process.
